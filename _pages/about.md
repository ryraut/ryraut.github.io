<h1>Hello!</h1> I am currently a Neuroscience PhD student at Washington University in St. Louis, in the lab of Marcus Raichle. I am interested in elucidating general principles of brain function, with special interest in data-driven approaches to understand basic laws governing how brain activity unfolds over space and time.

I can be reached at: ryanvraut [at] gmail [dot] com

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
